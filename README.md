# MNIST's Digits: Neural Network

This script was used for Kaggle's Digits competition.

The script uses a neural network (from the Keras library) to predict handwritten digits from MNIST's Digits dataset.

The neural net is a two-layer network using a rectifier activation for the hidden layer and softmax activation for the output.

With 100 epochs, the accuracy is 0.97386.
